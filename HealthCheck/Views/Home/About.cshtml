                    We are a website that offers psychological self-report questionnaires for people to evaluate their levels of Anxiety, Depression, OCD, and ADHD.
                    Their scores will provide clients with a general understanding of the degree of their distress as well as information on the nearest emergency mental
                    health treatment facilities, including their working hours and availability of doctors. Disorder surveys are available on our website,
                    but it's crucial to understand that these are not diagnostic instruments. We submit their findings to nearby hospitals that employ psychologists,
                    psychiatrists, and medical professionals with expertise in the detected disorder, allowing them to evaluate them using clinical diagnostic measures.
