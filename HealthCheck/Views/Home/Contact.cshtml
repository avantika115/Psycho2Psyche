            <h5>Disclaimer - </h5>
            <p>
                psycheo2psyche does not deal with medical or psychological emergencies. We are not designed to offer support in crisis situations - including when an individual is experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, or is showing symptoms of severe clinical disorders such as schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions. In these cases, in-person medical intervention is the most appropriate form of help.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel you are experiencing any of these difficulties, we would urge you to seek help at the nearest hospital or emergency room where you can connect with a psychiatrist, social worker, counsellor or therapist in person. We recommend you to involve a close family member or a friend who can offer support.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also reach out to a suicide hotline in your country of residence: <a href="http://www.healthcollective.in/contact/helplines">helpline.</a>
